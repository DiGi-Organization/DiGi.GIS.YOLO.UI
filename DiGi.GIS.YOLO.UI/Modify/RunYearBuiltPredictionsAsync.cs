        /// <para>Six steps per county: export the imagery, score it with the frozen detector, turn the detections into objects, write them into the building data, read the feature columns back and score them into a construction year, and store that year twice - dated into the year built data, and latest into the building data column.</para>
        /// <para>Each step carries its own flag, so a run can be resumed without repeating the expensive ones, and the three write steps are off by default, so a first pass over a county reads and scores but stores nothing unless a write step is named on. Each step is idempotent: the scratch paths are derived from the county identifier, the detector overwrites its results file rather than appending to it, and a stored year built datum is read back and added to rather than replaced.</para>
        /// <para>Only a building the detector fired on at least once is scored. A building it never fired on carries no per-year confidence series, which is the feature the regressor was built around, so scoring it would be scoring a row of absent features. The consequence is that the run predicts a year for fewer buildings than the file based workflow it replaces, which scored every row of its table - worth knowing before comparing the two reference by reference.</para>
        /// <para>The detection write is wider than the scoring: it covers every building whose imagery the detector was handed, and replaces each one's detection columns over <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionPipelineOptions.Years"/> as a whole. A building the current weights never fire on is therefore cleared rather than left carrying what earlier weights detected on it (DiGi-Organization/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#21). With the detection and the predicted year writes both on, the predicted year of such a building is cleared as well, since it was derived from the detection evidence that is now gone - a stored user year is never touched (DiGi-Organization/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#28).</para>
        /// <para>A county is exported and detected in chunks of at most <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionPipelineOptions.ChunkSize"/> buildings, each in a folder of its own under <c>chunks</c>, so no folder ever holds a whole county: one folder of 1.4 million files collapsed file creation on a machine generating NTFS 8.3 names. A scored chunk leaves a marker - its buildings, the buildings it had imagery for, and the weights' SHA-256 - and its imagery is removed; its results are joined into the county's <c>results.bbrf</c> once every chunk is scored, so the score-only input is unchanged. With <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionPipelineOptions.Resume"/> a chunk whose marker matches is stepped over. A county folder written before chunks is still read as it was written (DiGi-Organization/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#30).</para>
        /// <para><see cref="YearBuiltPredictionPipelineOptions.ReferencesFilePath"/> narrows every step to the buildings of a dataset manifest, and a manifest that does not read refuses the run before any county is touched (DiGi-Organization/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#22).</para>
        /// <para>The scope is checked before any of it starts. A county identifier that is in no county row - most often a four character county code passed where an identifier was wanted - matches no stored building, so every step reports a legitimate zero and the run ends green having done nothing at all. That is a mis-scoped run rather than an empty county, so it fails here instead.</para>
        /// <para>The options are checked against the model before any county is read. Narrowing them - asking for fewer years or radiuses than the model was trained on - drops features the model was fitted on, so every prediction silently degrades and it is refused. Widening them only adds features the model ignores, so it warns.</para>
        /// <para>The scratch folder of a county that came through without a failed step is removed once the run has finished with it, unless <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionPipelineOptions.CleanScratchDirectory"/> says otherwise - so nothing downstream can depend on what a successful county left behind, which is the gap the two pass workflow used to carry. A county that failed keeps its folder, so re-running it costs seconds rather than repeating the export and the inference.</para>
        /// <para>A county that fails is logged and stepped over, so one unreachable county cannot cost the run the counties behind it. The result therefore comes back either way - <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionResult.FailedStepNames"/> is what says whether the run did everything it set out to do.</para>
