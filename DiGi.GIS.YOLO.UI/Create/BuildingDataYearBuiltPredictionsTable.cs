        /// <para>With <paramref name="references"/> null the table is exactly what <see cref="GIS.IO.Modify.Update_Building2D_YearBuiltPredictions"/> builds - a row per detected building and a column per year some building of the batch was detected in. The endpoint upserts every column on the table and writes an unset cell as NULL, but a building or a column that is not on the table is left as it stands.</para>
        /// <para>That is not enough once the weights change. A building the new detector does not fire on is not on the table, so the previous detector's values - its false positives included - stay on it, and the stored detections become a mix of two detectors that nothing reports (DiGi-Organization/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#21). Naming the scored <paramref name="references"/> makes the write a replacement instead: every detection column of <paramref name="years"/> is on the table, and every scored reference without a detection gets a row of its own with those cells unset, so each scored building's detection columns are overwritten as a whole.</para>
        /// <para>A detected year outside <paramref name="years"/> is still written where it was detected, as before, and is not cleared elsewhere - the regressor does not read it.</para>

        /// <param name="years">The year range whose detection columns are replaced. Null applies the default range of <see cref="GIS.IO.Query.YearBuiltPredictionFeatureGroups(Range{int}?, IEnumerable{double}?)"/>, the same one the scoring step projects.
